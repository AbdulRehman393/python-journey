# class variables = Shared among all instances of a class
#                   Defined outside the constructor
#                   Allow you to share data among all objects created from that class


# instance variables are defined inside the constructor , class variables are defined outside the
# constructor

# Instance variables are for data that is different for each object. Class variables are for data that should be shared by all objects of the class.
